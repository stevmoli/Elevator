The Elevator watchface displays the time in both 24hr and 12hr mode and uses "elevator" rise and fall animations to update the time. When multiple digits change at once, they move in directions opposite those of the digits next to them. Other animations will run as needed to ensure that the digits are always evenly spaced, despite the width of digits not always being equal.  Currently, the face runs on the Aplite platform.

The font used is called "Hauptbahnhof," which was created by Frédéric Rich and can be downloaded here: http://www.dafont.com/hauptbahnhof.font

## Todo:
* Complete implementation of larger digits as images so that the face better utilizes the Pebble's screen size
* Add Basalt platform support and some customization options
